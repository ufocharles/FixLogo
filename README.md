Problems I ran into:
Trying to use the mousemove event could work but trying to figure out if the dots were in the right place was tricky so i abandoned that idea and used the drag properties of the elements which worked very well with minimal problems. 
The fact that i have to use relative and absolute positioning still posed another problem keeping the page consistent across screen sizes.
The only way to keep the coordinates of the dots the same on every screen size is to make the body the zise of the logo 600px.
